# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview:
From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization.

With our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.


## Result:

### Data Processing
- Variable IS_SUCCESSFUL was considered the target for the model.
- APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT was considered as the features for the model.
- The columns EIN and NAME were neither targets nor features, so it was removed from the input data.
